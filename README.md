# Covid_19-Data-Analysis-Project
Covid_19 Data Analysis Project Using Excel And PowerBi

Background:

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound effect on global health, economies, and societies. With vast amounts of data available from various sources—such as case counts, vaccination rates, and mortality statistics—the need for a structured approach to analyze this data has become critical. This project focuses on leveraging these datasets to provide actionable insights.

Purpose of Analysis: COVID-19 Data Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to leverage COVID-19 data to achieve the following objectives:
The Questions to be asked based on this analysis are:

What was the total number of confirmed cases and deaths in the world?

Which countries had the highest number of confirmed cases and Deaths across the world?

At what rate did COVID-19 spread across all the continents in the world?

How did Covid-19 affect countries based on population?

How did Covid-19 spread trend from 2020 to 2023?

Process Methodology

. Data Collection

. Data Cleaning

. Data Validation and Exploration

. Visualization and Dashboard Creation

. Data Cleaning: The tool used: Excel. The cleaning process involved deleting rows with null values from the continent column, deleting columns that were not needed for this analysis and converting data types.

Outcome:

The project will deliver a set of actionable insights and predictive forecasts to support public health officials, policymakers, and researchers. By understanding the patterns and impacts of COVID-19 through data analysis, stakeholders can better navigate the ongoing challenges of the pandemic and plan for future public health responses.
